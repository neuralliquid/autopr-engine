# AutoPR Phase 1: Quality Pipeline Implementation Plan

**Current Step:** 1.2.2 Implement `Comprehensive` mode (All static analysis tools)

## 1. Enhance the Quality Engine Implementation

### 1.1 Refactor Quality Engine Architecture ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] 1.1.1 Create tool abstraction for different quality tools (`base.py`)
- [x] 1.1.2 Implement tool discovery mechanism (`__init__.py`)
- [x] 1.1.3 Integrate tool discovery into QualityEngine
- [x] 1.1.4 Add configuration loading from project settings (`config.py`)
- [x] 1.1.5 Implement dynamic tool loading in QualityEngine `execute` method

### 1.2 Implement Quality Modes

- [x] 1.2.1 Implement `Fast` mode (Quick checks: formatting, basic linting)
- [x] 1.2.2 Implement `Comprehensive` mode (All static analysis tools) ✅
- [ ] 1.2.3 Implement `AI-Enhanced` mode (Use AI for additional suggestions)
- [ ] 1.2.4 Implement `Smart` mode (Adaptive mode that selects tools based on context)
- [x] Ensure that the configuration correctly maps tools to modes
- [x] Validate the loaded configuration to prevent runtime errors (e.g., missing tools)

#### 1.2.2 Comprehensive Mode Requirements

- [x] Integrate all available static analysis tools
- [x] Add dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] Include code complexity analysis
- [x] Add documentation coverage checks
- [x] Implement security scanning with multiple tools
- [x] Add performance analysis tools
- [x] Support JavaScript/TypeScript tools

### 1.3 Enhance the execute Method

- [x] Add detailed logging for which tools are being run
- [ ] Handle edge cases such as empty file lists or disabled tools
- [ ] Add Unit Tests for all modes
- [ ] Test the execute method with a variety of inputs:
  - [ ] Valid files with issues
  - [ ] Empty file list
  - [ ] Disabled tools in the configuration
  - [ ] CLI Integration Testing
  - [ ] Verify that the CLI accepts the --mode argument and executes successfully
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling when no files are provided

### 1.4 Implement Core Quality Tools Integration ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED

- [x] 1.4.1 Integrate Ruff for linting
- [x] 1.4.2 Integrate MyPy for type checking
- [x] 1.4.3 Integrate Bandit for security scanning
- [x] 1.4.4 Integrate Interrogate for documentation checking
- [x] 1.4.5 Integrate Radon for complexity analysis
- [x] 1.4.6 Integrate PyTest for testing
- [x] 1.4.7 Integrate CodeQL for vulnerability scanning
- [x] 1.4.8 Integrate SonarQube for overall code quality
- [x] 1.4.9 Integrate other tools as needed (ESLint, Dependency Scanner, Performance Analyzer) ✅
- [x] 1.4.10 Add support for custom tools ✅
- [x] 1.4.11 Add JavaScript/TypeScript tools support ✅

### 1.5 Implement AI Enhancement Layer

- [ ] 1.5.1 Implement AI feedback for code quality
- [ ] 1.5.2 Integrate with existing model providers
- [ ] 1.5.3 Implement suggestion filtering and application

## 2. Pre-commit & CI Integration

### 2.1 Enhance .pre-commit-config.yaml

- [x] 2.1.1 Add Ruff hook ✅
- [x] 2.1.2 Add MyPy hook ✅
- [x] 2.1.3 Add Bandit hook ✅
- [x] 2.1.4 Configure hooks to use the Quality Engine ✅

### 2.2 Create Pre-commit Hooks

- [x] 2.2.1 Create hook script for Quality Engine ✅
- [x] 2.2.2 Configure different modes through hook arguments ✅
- [x] 2.2.3 Add documentation in hook descriptions ✅

### 2.3 Create GitHub Actions Workflow

- [x] 2.3.1 Create `quality.yml` workflow for PR checks ✅
- [x] 2.3.2 Configure workflow to run pre-commit checks ✅
- [x] 2.3.3 Add separate step for comprehensive checks ✅
- [x] 2.3.4 Configure caching for faster runs ✅

### 2.4 Setup Reporting

- [x] 2.4.1 Configure report generation for quality metrics ✅
- [x] 2.4.2 Add PR comments with quality feedback ✅
- [x] 2.4.3 Create GitHub action summaries ✅

## 3. Testing & Documentation

### 3.1 Implement Unit Tests

- [x] 3.1.1 Create tests for Quality Engine core functionality ✅
- [x] 3.1.2 Add tests for each integrated tool ✅
- [x] 3.1.3 Implement tests for AI enhancement layer ✅

### 3.2 Implement Integration Tests

- [ ] 3.2.1 Test end-to-end Quality Engine flow
- [ ] 3.2.2 Test pre-commit hook execution
- [ ] 3.2.3 Test GitHub Actions workflow locally

### 3.3 Create Documentation Files

- [ ] 3.3.1 Create `README.md` with quality pipeline overview
  - [ ] Add sections describing EACH mode and their purpose
  - [ ] Document tools used in each mode
  - [ ] Include usage examples
